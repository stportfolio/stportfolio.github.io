	<h2>Ultra Lux </h2>
	<b>Preface:</b>

<p>The survivalist community is rife with tutorials for how to fill a common mint tin with just the necessities to survive a catastrophe. These tins are not meant to be long term survival aids, but to provide just enough to help until one can reach safety.

The ultra luxury market is impervious to market fluctuation. The Hermès Birkin handbag has proven since its debut 35 years ago to be a more stable “investment” of capital than traditional stocks or gold. </p>

<b>Statement:</b>

<p>This “survival” kit, provides only intangible reminders of wealth and excess in the form of lenticular prints of the most pervasive ultra luxury goods on the market today. Keeping these objects close at hand as symbols of their former selves in a post-consumerist, post-capitalist future. The physical presence of the object is rendered obsolete, but to serve as a point of reflection on a future time past.

The tin in this case is a jewelry box contains six lenticular prints, three of the most expensive handbags currently selling or sold at auction (all of them Hermès, two Birkin and one Kelly) and the three most expensive gems (diamond, sapphire, ruby) sold at auction.<Br><br>
