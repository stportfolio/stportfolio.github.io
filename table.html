	<h2>Encoded Intonation Table Suite</h2>
	<p>Our bodies are containers of data. In our current world storage capacities, capabilities and methods are augmented by technology. A union between digital, machine production, and traditional process gives rise to new methods of deriving form from what was previously unseen. I am interested in the abstraction that occurs when the two processes meet and how that can communicate or obscure the intimacy of interacting with one another. <Br><br>

This series of work utilizes recordings sourced from people I frequently share meals with. The table and objects are surfaces incidental to the catalyzation of such interactions. Speech begins from the body as expansion and compressions within disrupt particles in the air, surrounding us to be registered by the smallest bones of the body. The nuances of actions and interactions, the pauses for breath, the organization of thoughts are what I investigate in these liminal spaces in interaction with one another. These moments are memorialized in tableware objects. <Br><br>

	Shown in situ at the spring 2014 BFA thesis exhibition, DeVos Art Museum, Northern Michigan University, Marquette Michigan.<Br><br>

Installation consists of: one 5'x5' hand embroidered table cloth, two hand embroidered cloth napkins, two etched glasses, flatware set, and set of cast porcelain plates.tab</p>
