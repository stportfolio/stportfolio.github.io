	<h2>Encoded Intonation III</h2>
	<p>Encoded Intonation III is a series of dinner ware, made utilizing field recordings sourced from people I frequently share meals with. Layering the encoded intimacy of sharing a meal, sharing a thought, and the surfaces that catalyze such interactions. Conversation is of particular interest, speech begins from the body as compressions and expansion within, disrupting particles in the air, surrounding us to be registered by the smallest bones. These moments are memorialized in tableware objects feeding the recordings through open source programs to generates three dimensional data sets. Specific points within the generated data set are selected, these curves represent the amplitude of the sound over time. These waves shape the edges of the dinner plates modeled in Rhinoceros. I then design a two part mold using the original plate model to slip cast with. These molds are CNC machined from plaster blanks I cast. Using machining I am able to create, in the tangible world, a replica of what I model on the computer.
